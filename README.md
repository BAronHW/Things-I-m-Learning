A log Of all the things I am currently learning in the field of software engineering/programming and also expanding my knowledge in all things technology. I hope to update/learn atleast something new everyday.

<summary>Web Development</summary>
I am taking this course because I am interested in front-end development which I think this course will teach me. I am also interested in how the front end interacts with the backend and therefore I saw that this full-stack course will suit my needs.
